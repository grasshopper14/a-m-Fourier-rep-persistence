Chemrxiv preprint available [here](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/687f20a623be8e43d6611055)

The data for protease activity is available [here ](https://github.com/avaamini/protease_activity_analysis/tree/master/data/stm_kinetic).
Procedure to fit the a-m model superposition is provided [here](https://github.com/grasshopper14/a-m-kinetics).
